A DIY Group Golf Group Scoring System comprised of: a web app "front-end" and sheets/scripts "back-end" to determine results that are then automatically emailed.

See this Google Slides for Overview -  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OFxCkHToD8Xv5ndpid2VGXrdgu85IuHQ4WKWKOxWPaI/edit?usp=sharing

Given they are Google App files (web app, sheets, and documentation), upon purchase I'll provide "viewer only" access to a Google Drive directory.  Users will then need to make copies for their own Google Drive and then: 1) edit the file links each of the files' scripts (so they can work together), and then 2) deploy the web app.  Very easy!  Plus, you can taior it with your own golf group logo by just replacing an html link.

While easy to set up/use and I provide decent guidance, users should have some of this experience:
- spreadsheets,
- basic html.
- basic system admin, and
- very basic programming.

  
Hope to have the files out for distro soon.  Only $20 for the system -- and will provide lots of setup/use info and some limited support for that.
