# GoogleGolf-Scoring-System
A DIY Group Golf Group Scoring System comprised of web app front end and sheets/scripts to determine results that are automatically emailed.

See this Google Slides for Overview -  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OFxCkHToD8Xv5ndpid2VGXrdgu85IuHQ4WKWKOxWPaI/edit?usp=sharing

Hope to have the files out for distro soon.  Asking $20 for them -- and will provide lots of setup info and some limited supprt for that.

Contact me if interested -- Alan Welch  welch_misc@yahoo.com
